**Arduino Setup**

Information about the ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1 development board can be found at (their links are broken lol) https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.3.1/esp32s3/api-reference
In your Arduino setup Board Manager, we are using the ‘**ESP32S3 Dev Module**’ board. Installations:

1. Arduino IDE https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
And then within “Boards Manager”, install “esp32 by Espressif Systems”.
2. Install the USB to Uart bridge driver from: https://www.silabs.com/developer-tools/usb-to-
uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads
3. Once downloaded and extracted, locate the “silabser.inf” file (see below) and then right click
and “Install”.
